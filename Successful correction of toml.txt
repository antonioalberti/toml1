Enter any specific instructions for the AI (or leave blank): The config.toml file should define a Chainlink job that creates an external price oracle. The job listens for oracle requests on contract 0xc970705401D0D61A05d49C33ab2A39A5C49b2f94 on chain ID 1337, with external ID ca98366c-c731-4957-b8c0-12c72f05aeea. When triggered, it performs a GET request to the CoinGecko API to fetch the price of Ethereum in USD, parses the result, multiplies it by 100 (to handle decimals), and sends the result back to the blockchain via a transaction that calls the fulfillOracleRequest2 method. The data pipeline includes decoding the request log, HTTP fetch, JSON parsing, value multiplication, and data encoding for the response transaction. The job includes all essential Job Configuration properties at the top of the file. These include: type (defines the job type, e.g., "directrequest"), schemaVersion (typically set to 1), name (a human-readable identifier), externalJobID (a unique UUID for external reference), contractAddress (address of the triggering smart contract, required for job types like directrequest), evmChainID (identifies the EVM chain, e.g., 1 for Ethereum mainnet or 1337 for local testnets), forwardingAllowed (boolean, often false for direct requests), minIncomingConfirmations (minimum block confirmations before processing, e.g., 0), minContractPaymentLinkJuels (minimum LINK payment in juels, e.g., "0"), and maxTaskDuration (maximum time a task may run, e.g., "30s"). When generating or validating a job spec, include these fields with appropriate formatting and values based on the job type, and follow with the observationSource block for defining the task pipeline (e.g., http -> jsonparse -> multiply -> ethtx).
